# Structural consistency checks for the Designpowers repo.
#
# These guard the classes of drift that accumulate silently as skills and
# agents are added — the exact issues this check was created to catch:
#   1. Orphaned skills  — a skill dir with no trigger reference in the router
#   2. Dead skill refs  — a router table row points at a skills/<x> that's missing
#   3. README counts    — "N skills" must match the number of skill dirs
#   4. Agent tallies    — "Agents used/dispatched: [X of N]" must use the real agent count
#
# Exits non-zero on any problem so CI can gate on it. Pure bash + grep, no deps.
